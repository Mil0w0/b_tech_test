# Multi stage docker file
#
# 1st stage is a builder, it's used to build the nodeJS application
# 2nd stage is a runner, it's used to run the nodeJS application
#
# This allow the usage of lighter docker image in production resulting on better startups
# Also, having only the requiered stuff to run the app avoid eventual threat on the security from useless services
#
